# Drinkers-United

### The challenge
In the first of the group projects we were tasked with building a website from the ground up, utilizing 2 APIs and a css library other than Bootstrap. 
### User Story
As a user, I want to be able to search for breweries in a city if I want to go out, or be able to search for cocktail recipes to make at home. We also made a search list that is saved into local storage and can be deleted with a 'clear' button. 

### Acceptance Criteria
Application uses at least two server-side APIs.

We use API for cocktail:
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1

API for brewery:
https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries

Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data.

We added the local storage for every search

Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).

We only use Modal

Application is used under Bulma

Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input).
